Certainly! Below is a basic template for a README file that covers the process of building your project, including authentication, getting an access token, and passing it to get meeting ID pages. Feel free to customize it based on the specific details of your project:

# Your Project Name

Welcome to your project! This README provides an overview of how the project is structured and the steps involved in building and deploying it.

## Overview

Briefly describe your project, its purpose, and any key features.

## Project Structure

Explain the organization of your project. Highlight key directories and their purposes.

```

```

## Authentication

Describe how authentication is handled in your project. If you are using OAuth, API keys, or any other method, provide an overview here.

## Getting Access Token

Explain the process of obtaining an access token. Include any necessary steps, such as authentication, and specify the endpoint or service used to get the access token.

```javascript
// Example code snippet
const accessToken = await getAccessToken();
console.log('Access Token:', accessToken);
```

## Getting Meeting ID

Outline the steps involved in obtaining a meeting ID using the access token. Include relevant code snippets and describe any API calls or services used.

```javascript
// Example code snippet
const meetingID = await getMeetingID(accessToken);
console.log('Meeting ID:', meetingID);
```

## Deployment

Provide instructions on how to deploy your project. Include any specific commands or configurations needed for deployment.
If you're using the `serve` command specifically for the client directory, you can simplify the deployment instructions. Here's an updated set of steps:

### Deployment Steps for Viewers:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
   - Run the following command:

     ```bash
     git clone [https://github.com/TaNiShQ-000/zoom-api.git]
     ```

   
2. **Navigate to the Client Directory:**
   - Move into the client directory:

     ```bash
     cd zoom-api/client
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Install project dependencies:

     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

4. **Build and Serve the React App:**
   - Build the React app and serve it locally using the `serve` command:

     ```bash
     npm run build
     serve -s build
     ```

   This will start the server and make the app accessible locally.

5. **View the Application:**
   - Open your web browser.
   - Go to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) (or the port mentioned in the terminal where the app is being served).

Now, viewers should be able to see and interact with the deployed version of your React app locally. Share the instructions above with them so they can run and test the application on their own machines.

Again, make sure to replace placeholder values with your actual GitHub username and repository name. Adjust these instructions based on the specific structure and requirements of your project.
